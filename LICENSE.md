=================================

Copyright (c) 2025 Appremon AI, LLC and/or the VextCODE project
(collectively, the “Licensor”).

All rights not expressly granted under this License are reserved by
Licensor.

This is a source-available, non-commercial, limited-use License. It is
not an “open source license” as defined by the Open Source Initiative.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. DEFINITIONS

------------------------------------------------------------

```text
1.1 “Software” means the source code and object code of any software
project, library, tool, or component that Licensor distributes or
designates as being licensed under this VextCODE Public License v1.0
(the “License”), including, without limitation, current and future
products such as VextEDB (database), VextBus (message queue and
pub/sub system), VextSecrets (secrets manager), and any accompanying
official tools, plugins, or utilities.

1.2 “Work” means a particular copy of the Software, in source or
object code form, together with any associated configuration, build
scripts, documentation, or other files distributed with it.

1.3 “Commercial Use” means any use of the Software by a for-profit
entity, Government Entity, or individual acting on behalf of such an
entity, in connection with activities that directly or indirectly
support revenue, profit, cost savings, operational efficiency, or
governmental functions, whether or not the Software itself is sold.

1.4 “Government Entity” means any national, federal, state,
provincial, municipal, or other governmental or quasi-governmental
body, including their agencies, departments, and instrumentalities.

1.5 “Non-Profit Organization” means an entity organized and operated
exclusively for charitable, educational, scientific, religious, or
similar public-benefit purposes, that does not distribute profits to
owners or shareholders.

1.6 “Small Deployment” means a deployment of the Software by a single
legal entity where all of the following are true:

    (a) no more than three (3) production instances of each Product
        that forms part of the Software (including, without
        limitation, VextEDB, VextBus, VextSecrets) are running at any
        time; and

    (b) the Software is used by or on behalf of no more than ten (10)
        human users (such as employees, contractors, or agents) with
        access to the Software or systems directly backed by it; and

    (c) the Software serves applications with fewer than one thousand
        (1,000) monthly active end users in total; and

    (d) the deploying entity’s annual gross revenue is less than
        USD $1,000,000 (one million United States dollars).

If any of the conditions (a)–(d) is not satisfied, the deployment is
not a Small Deployment.

1.7 “Limited Commercial Use” means Commercial Use of the Software
solely in a Small Deployment and solely for the internal operations of
the deploying entity, and not as part of any paid, hosted, managed, or
outsourced service offering to third parties.

1.8 “You” (or “Your”) means any individual or legal entity exercising
rights under this License.

1.9 “Modify” or “Modification” means any change to the Software,
including by adding to, deleting from, or otherwise altering source
code or build configuration, or by combining the Software with other
code in a way that creates a derivative work under applicable
copyright laws.

1.10 “Distribute” means to make available to any third party, whether
by transfer, licensing, sublicensing, sale, hosting, or otherwise,
including by providing the Software in a product or service.
```

------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY

------------------------------------------------------------

```text
2.1 Default License for VextCODE Software.

Unless a particular Work distributed by Licensor includes a separate
license file named “LICENSE.md” that clearly states different terms,
this VextCODE Public License v1.0 applies to that Work.

2.2 Project-Specific Licenses.

If a Work includes a file named “LICENSE.md” that specifies license
terms for that Work, and those terms conflict with or differ from this
License, the terms in that “LICENSE.md” file shall govern the use of
that Work. This License does not alter the terms of any such
project-specific license.

2.3 Third-Party Components.

Third-party components included in or used by the Software may be
subject to separate license terms. Those terms are not modified by
this License and continue to apply in accordance with their own
licenses.
